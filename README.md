## Install instructions

This project was designed and tested using Python 3.10.
To setup the project, you have to:
1. clone the repository;
2. [install the Python dependencies](#python-dependencies);
3. [download the datasets](#dataset).

### Python dependencies
These are listed in `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Additionally, `spacy`-related models are needed:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy_entity_linker "download_knowledge_base"
```

### Dataset
We're using a modified version of [LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset](http://lc-quad.sda.tech/) created for ["Entity Linking and Filling for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02865v1) paper.

```
wget -P data/ 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesemanticwebhero/ElNeuKGQA/main/data/dataset_lcquad2.json'
```

## Usage instructions
### Basic usage

You can run the `demo.ipynb` notebook.

### Reproduce the experiments mentionned in the report


## Repository structure
- [`README`](/README.md): this file.
- [`main.py`](/main.py): Python script for training the models.
- [`report/`](/report/): folder for project report PDF `Final_report-My_Awesome_Readme.pdf`.
- [`presentations/`](/presentations/): folder containing all the intermediate presentations as PDF (must be updated before each presentation session). Each file is labled with the date of presentations.
- [`results/`](/results/): folder containing all the results generated during the project.
    - [`results/models/`](/results/models/): folder containing the models trained during the project.
    - [`results/plots/`](/results/plots/): folder containing the plots describing the performance and the experiments.
    - [`results/solutions/`](/results/solutions/): folder containing the solutions to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.
- [`articles/`](/articles/): folder containing all the articles read or mentioned in the report, as PDFs. Each file is labled using the template `[article topic]-[publication year]-[authors' last names].pdf`; if more than 3 authors are present, `[authors' last names]` is replaced by `[first author's last name]-et-al` instead.
