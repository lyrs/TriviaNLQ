### Python dependencies


### Dataset
The dataset we use is called [TriviaQA](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/).

```
mkdir data
curl "https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/data/triviaqa-unfiltered.tar.gz" | tar -xzv -C data/
```


## Usage instructions
### Basic usage

### Reproduce the experiments mentioned in the report


## Repository structure
- [`README-example.md`](/README-example.md): this file.
- [`main.py`](/main.py): Python script for training the models.
- [`experiment1.py`](/experiment1.py): Python script to run the experiment on the synthetic data, mentionned in section 4.2. of the report.
- [`experiment2.py`](/experiment2.py): Python script to run the experiment on the real-world data from ..., mentionned in section 4.4. of the report.
- [`report/`](/report/): folder for project report PDF `Final_report-My_Awesome_Readme.pdf`.
- [`presentations/`](/presentations/): folder containing all the intermediate presentations as PDF (must be updated before each presentation session). Each file is labled using the template `[date]-Presentation_[presentation number]-My_Awesome_Readme.pdf`. *This template is my personal preference. You can use your own, as long as it is clear from the name which presentation corresponds to which file.*
- [`results/`](/results/): folder containing all the results generated during the project.
    - [`results/models/`](/results/models/): folder containing the models trained during the project.
    - [`results/plots/`](/results/plots/): folder containing the plots describing the performance and the experiments.
    - [`results/solutions/`](/results/solutions/): folder containing the solutions to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.
- [`articles/`](/articles/): folder containing all the articles read or mentioned in the report, as PDFs. Each file is labled using the template `[article topic]-[publication year]-[authors' last names].pdf`; if more than 3 authors are present, `[authors' last names]` is replaced by `[first author's last name]-et-al` instead.
